### Colour-Scheme

I choose the following colors throughout the quiz to ensure an elegeant and 
user friendly page. 
I choose the main background color of the page as a block colour which is appealing to the eye. 
I ensured the heading was very simple and easy to read. 
I like a plain heading to contrast with the block background colour of blue. I think the blue and white is appealing visually.
I was influenced by the kera-cudmore The QuizArms and the overall workings of the quiz.
I was further influcned by Web dev [insert youtube link here]

The following colors were used as a mix of hex colors and rgna to make the color and contrast 
lighter and darker as needed 

1. #ffffff white background color of the container 

2. #006994 blue as the background colour 

3. #333 border bottom short hand property for setting border style and color

4. #ffffff8 light color and shade of white for the background color of the heading

5. #rgba, 255, 255, 255, 0.897 light shade of grey background in the button

6. #222 background of button - dark color for button font grey dark grey

7. #fff light color version of white 

8. #008035; green for correct answer 

9. #ff080073; red for an incorrect answer

### Typography
I choose fonts from [Google Fonts] which is a very popular website for importing fonts. 
I choose it for acessibility and it had the fonts weights and fonts very easily displayed. 
It was very east to import and copy the font which I did it did not require the font to be downloaded

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Geography%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto

I choose the fonts Roboto', sans-serif; which are clear easily visible and commonly used. I was influenced by  xx I used the weight 300 as it had a nice finish and I was influenced from the  xx
I wamted to create a clean simple font-style 
the two i choose are very clear and neat
font choice font awesome and google fonts Light 300 font chosen. 

hexcode for light grey was chosen - #D3D3D3 #d3dede check which color.
