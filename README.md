### Colour-Scheme

I choose the following colors throughout the quiz to ensure an elegeant and 
user friendly page. 
I choose the main background color of the page as a block colour which is appealing to the eye. 
I ensured the heading was very simple and easy to read. 
I like a plain heading to contrast with the block background colour of blue. I think the blue and white is appealing visually.
I was influenced by the kera-cudmore The QuizArms and the overall workings of the quiz.
