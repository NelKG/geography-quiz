### Colour-Scheme

I choose the following colors throughout the quiz to ensure an elegeant and 
user friendly page. 
I choose the main background color of the page as a block colour which is appealing to the eye. 
I ensured the heading was very simple and easy to read. 
I like a plain heading to contrast with the block background colour of blue. I think the blue and white is appealing visually.

I was influenced by the kera-cudmore The QuizArms and the overall workings of the quiz.
I was further influecned by Web dev [youtube link here] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k>

The following colors were used as a mix of hex colors and rgba to make the color and contrast 
lighter and darker as needed 

1. #ffffff white background color of the container 

2. #006994 blue as the background colour 

3. #333 border bottom short hand property for setting border style and color

4. #ffffff8 light color and shade of white for the background color of the heading

5. #rgba, 255, 255, 255, 0.897 light shade of grey background in the button

6. #222 background of button - dark color for button font grey dark grey

7. #fff light color version of white 

8. #008035; green for correct answer 

9. #ff080073; red for an incorrect answer

### Typography
I choose fonts from [Google Fonts] which is a very popular website for importing fonts. 
I choose it for acessibility and it had the fonts weights and fonts very easily displayed. 
It was very east to import and copy the font which I did it did not require the font to be downloaded

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Geography%20Quiz&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto

I choose the fonts Roboto', sans-serif; which are clear easily visible and commonly used.  I used the weight 300 as it had a nice finish.
I wamted to create a clean simple font-style,the two i choose are very clear and neat
font choice font awesome and google fonts Light 300 font chosen. 

hexcode for light grey was chosen - #D3D3D3 #d3dede check which color. 

I used an icon of a question mark which I imported from [here is a link to the webpage] (https://fontawesome.com/)

  ### Features 


### General Features on the page
There is a start button. Once the start button is clicked. The quiz will begin and the question container 
will appear. The question counter, correct and incorrect answers will appear and update once the next button is clicked. 

### Future Implementation 
For future implementation I would make the quiz more interactive 
I would ensure that there is a score feature added to the score area and that a Final score button is 
created to ensure the quiz participant can see their quiz and also see can them improve on their previous score 
I would ensure that the next button and resart button are working perfectly.

### Accessibility 
I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### Lighthouse

### Testing 



### Debugging 
its an ongoing process
I'm learning every day and becoming more knowledgdeable 
changing the position of the containers 
remove the next button once the restart button is clicked 
adding a reset values function to the quiz and a score display is future work which must be done 

### Credits 
I learned from the material provided in the Love Maths project and the material given in the code institute course. I used several sources and  you tube tutorials to learn how to get the question counter and the correct and incorrect buttons to work - 

### Code Used
 
The code used in this project was taken from several sources and influenced by several resources
1. Web dev dimplified - [youtube] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8>

2. [James Quick Youtube ] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfOv18lCMmw&>

4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfOv18lCMmw&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=11>

 The part of the quiz function correct answer was taken from a youtube tutorial listed above no 1 and no 3.

 All the code used in this project was used from the sources above in the tutorials listed above.
 The initial idea and structure of the quiz was influenced by Web Dev and youtube tutorial no 3 listed above.
 I have used more code than I intended to from the sources above and tried to change it and edit it to perform in way I wanted the quiz to work.
